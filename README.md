Human Trafficking is one of the major concerns in the society. Our team suggests a strategy that takes advantage of artificial intelligence's powerful computing capacity to address the problem in light of its recent explosion.

#### About 
A deep learning-based system that is able to identify any suspicious activity by analyzing the camera's live video in real time. The closest police stations and hospitals can receive information, such as the incident's location.

**What is considered anomalous activity?**
Any activity which differs from a normal activity above a calculated threshold can be marked as anomalous activity. For example - A busy road in city can be considered as a normal activity whereas riots or voilent activites on the same roads will be considered anomalous.
